There are several key elements to this repo:

+ Qmd file of final project
+ Pdf project report
+ Datasets. I uploaded the datasets for this project in cvs form. Those are datasets supplied by Airbnb for the competition to help us with the prediction
+ Project Checklist

my project is about predicting new user's first booking at Airbnb,This process was done by solving Airbnb’s Kaggle problem where they wanted Kaggle users to predict where their users were most likely going to travel based on data from their website. The goal for this project is to:

+ Support Destination-Specific-Advertising through User Accomodation
+ Explore Distributions of the Values of Interest through EDA
+ Predict or Infer User’s First Book Destination from their Information 


The analyzed value of interest:
+ Device Usage
+ New User’s Population
+ First travel-destination Country
